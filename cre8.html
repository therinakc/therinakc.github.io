  <h1 class="fade-in project-subtitle cre8-title">Overview</h1>
  <p class="project-description">For UX Laurier’s designathon, teams were tasked with creating a solution to help encourage users rekindle their curiosity and inner child to enhance their learning. My partner and I designed Cre8, a mobile app that provides a way to get in touch with your inner child by seeing art in everyday life and drawing anything you see in your surroundings!</p>
    <p class="project-description">With Cre8, users get a random daily notification to stop and take a picture wherever they are, and draw on their phone anything they see, from a turtle to a smiley face :)
  </p>

<!--Problem-->
  <a id="problem"></a>
<div class=" container reveal"><h1 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Problem</h1>
  <p class="project-description">
    Have you ever watched a child explore their environment with wonder and curiosity? 
    They're like little scientists, always testing and experimenting, 
    eager to learn about the world around them. 
    As adults, we often lose touch with that sense of wonder and curiosity. 
    But when it comes to children, fostering that sense of exploration is essential 
    for their growth and development.</p>
    <p class="project-description">
    As adults, it's also important for us to reconnect with that sense of wonder 
    and curiosity we had as children. We can explore unknown territories, 
    find comfort in unfamiliar places, build new relationships, discover hidden passions and talents, 
    and so much more.</p>
    <p class="project-description">
    By intentionally tapping into our inner child, 
    we'll keep our minds alive with wonder and open to a world of endless opportunities.
  </p>
  <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle cre8-title">About the Project</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    From this, teams were given the problem of:
  </p>
  <div class="wrapper">
  <blockquote class="shadow-cre8">
    <h2 class="cre8-title">
      How might we design an experience that sparks curiosity, self-reflection, and experimentation to enhance learning and discovery?
    </h2>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p class="project-description">
  The challenge of figuring out our solution was that we had to consider learning/creativity and exploration in various aspects of life. 
  This meant that we were open to tackle any aspect that we felt is not addressed enough in users’ everyday lives.  
</p>
<p class="project-description">Our ideas ranged from helping users learn a new skill such as a musical instrument or language, to exploring art and user's creative side.
  One thing that my partner and I wanted to ensure our solution had is an app that can be used during one's busy schedule to give them a break.
</p>

<a id="research"></a>
<div class=" container reveal">
<h1 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Research</h1>

<h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle cre8-title">Defining our Target Audience & User Personas:</h2>
<p class="project-description">
  For our target audience, we wanted to aim for university students and working individuals (ages 18+). This is because we wanted to focus on rekindling their inner child as my partner and I have experienced burn out frequently in our university careers.
</p>
<p class="project-description">Knowing this, we created our user personas, Emily and Jose, and began brainstorming potential solutions that would aim towards our target audience and solve the given problem.
</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8em.png" width="90%"/>
</div>
<div class="col">
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8jose.png" width="90%"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="project-description">Originally, I focused on the learning aspect of the problem and giving users a way to learn a new skill in their free time. One idea I had was "Duolingo but for musical instruments" with my interest in music.
  However, I wasn't sure how to incorporate the more creative aspect that my 
    partner wanted to include until we decided to combine our ideas!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">
    Her idea was to have users take a picture of their surroundings and draw any figures they may see, just like they might've done as a kid but in their heads.
    This was combined with my idea to learn a new skill by learning a new language.
  </p>
<p class="project-description">
  For our research we performed competitive analysis and hosted a survey to gain a better
  understanding of what features we need to include in our solution to ensure the best experience.
</p>
  <p class="project-description"></p>
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle cre8-title">Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      In our competitive analysis, we looked at BeReal, Instagram, and Procreate.
    </p>
    <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8companalysis.png" width="80%"/>
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle cre8-title">User Survey</h2>
<p class="project-description">
  In our online survey, we asked users questions related to their day-to-day lives and their careers.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">We got response from users aged 18-30+ and our foundings included:
</p>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-md-3 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-xs-1">
  
  <div class="col ">
    <div class="cre8-circle">100%</div>
    <div class="research">of participants have felt burnt out from work or school</div>
  </div>

  <div class="col ">
    <div class="cre8-circle">> 60%</div>
    <div class="research">of participants are interested in learning a new skills, such as a new language, in their free time.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="col ">
    <div class="cre8-circle">> 60%</div>
    <div class="research">of participants answered that their creativity may have decreased as they age due to factors such as, burnout, lack of time, and mental barriers</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol class="project-description">
  <li>Burnt out is a common feeling that working individuals deal with.</li>
  <li>Users need a way to escape this burnout, especially during their busy schedule.</li>
  <li>Users have less opportunities to be creative as they grow up due to work or school.</li>
  <li>If given the time, users would take the time to learn a new skill even if it's unrelated to their current career.</li>
</ol>

  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">User Flow</h2>
  <p class="project-description">To keep track of the screens and wireframes we needed to design, and ensure the best
    user experience in Cre8, we created a user flow.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    The user flow was created based on the main features the target user would use with Cre8.
  </p>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8userflow.png" width="100%"/>
  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Styleguide</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    For the overall style of Cre8, we wanted it to be approachable for users. Our main goal for Cre8 is to be a place where users don't have to worry about their work for a short time and be able to express their creativity.

  <p class="project-description"></p>
  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Mentor Feedback</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    During the designathon, we were given the opportunity to attend 
    mentorship sessions with industry professionals in the UX field!
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    For Cre8, we spoke with <b>Han Bang</b>, a Product Design Manager at Scotiabank.
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Simplifying Features</h3>
  <p class="project-description">
    Originally, we wanted users to be able to learn a new language while doing their daily drawings.
    For their drawing of the day, they would be able to translate their
    phrase to the language of their choice and also see what other users learned for the day.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Feedback:</b> It seemed like it was just thrown in with no relation to the drawing idea. We should just stick to one idea as it is solid by itself and having the translation aspect may overwhelm the user.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Result:</b> We narrowed down our app to only focus on the creative aspect and letting users unleash their creative side through daily drawings.
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Blank Canvas Colour Palette</h3>
  <p class="project-description">
    Originally, our colour palette only consisted of the colours from our style guide, no white.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Feedback:</b> Since it is a drawing app, white can be used to represent a blank canvas that users are able to draw on.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Result:</b> We switched to white for our primary colour and the colours from our style guide as secondary colours.
  </p>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/colourfb.png" width="40%"/>

  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Increase User Interaction</h3>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Feedback:</b> Increasing user interaction can help spark curiosity between users rather than leaving it as a solo experience.
    This can be through users guessing what others' drawings are or commenting what you see in their picture/drawing.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    <b>Result:</b> We added the commenting feature which is described more in detail below.
  </p>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/commentfb.png" width="30%"/>
  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Features</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    From the feedback we received, we were able to narrow down our main features to these four:
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Drawing on Photos</h3>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8feat.png" width="30%"/>
  <p class="project-description">
    See a turtle in the clouds? Snap a pic of it and draw out the turtle using Cre8 or any another shapes you see.
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Random Daily Notification</h3>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8feat2.png" width="30%"/>
  <p class="project-description">
    Explore your creativity daily. Cre8 sends out a notification when it's time to take a picture and draw what you see in your surroundings.
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">AI Recommendations</h3>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8feat3.png" width="30%"/>
  <p class="project-description">
    Not sure what to draw for the day? No worries! Cre8 has an AI that scans your photo and gives you suggestions on what to draw.
  </p>
  <h3 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Connecting with Other Users</h3>
  <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/cre8feat4.png" width="60%"/>
  <p class="project-description">
    View others' drawings for the day and add you drawing to their comments if you see something else in their picture!

  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Takeaways & What I Learned</h2>
  <p class="project-description">
    This designathon was an amazing learning opportunity for me! With all the sponsors and workshops that the event had, 
    I was able to get the most out of them and get a break from designing our solution by learning from industry professionals.
  </p>
  <p class="project-description">
    I not only learned a lot from the workshops I attended, but also from the whole UX process within the tight timeline as well as seeing other people’s solutions and seeing where we can improve!
  </p><p class="project-description">
    Getting feedback from professionals in the field helped my partner and I to see where we can focus our solution without including elements that overwhelm users.
   The problem given to us helped me to also rediscover my own creativity and have fun in designing a solution while learning at the same time. :)
  </p>
  <h2 class="project-subtitle cre8-title">Next Steps</h2>
  <ul class="project-description">
    <li><b>Updating UI:</b> Make it more appealing for users to ensure an easy and accessible experience while they create their masterpiece!
    </b></li>
    <li><b>Emphasizing feasibility:</b> One of the commnets we got was that we can go deeper into our solution and ensure feasibility even further.

    </b></li>
    <li><b>Increasing creativity:</b> Another comment we got is that AI might hinder user's creativity.
      It would be interesting to consider taking this out so users can take more time to draw.
