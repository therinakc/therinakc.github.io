    <h1 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Context</h1>
    <p class="project-description">In March of my Winter internship at the FAO, I collaborated with the Financial team to help design a visual for their April 21, 2022 report, <a href="https://www.fao-on.org/en/Blog/Publications/net-contribution-2022">The Impact of Provincial Spending and Revenue Collection on Ontario Families</a>. Typically for all of the FAO reports, matching infographics containing data or graphs from the report are created to be posted on social media. I was tasked with creating a visual that could be more interactive and personalized for users. Working closely with the lead graphic designer and Financial team, 
      I designed and programmed the Distribution Illustrator, an interactive graph containing data from the mentioned report.  </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
      <blockquote class="shadow-fao">
        <h2 class="fao-title">
          How often do users scroll through the whole report or engage in infographic social media links?
          <br>How can we increase user engagement?

      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Lengthy Reports</h2>
    <p class="project-description">With the amount of important information that the FAO reports cover, they tend to be on the longer side. 
      Because of this, it can be hard to maintain user engagement and retention as they scroll through the report. </p>
    <img style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/report.gif" width="50%"/>
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">User Engagement</h2>
    <p class="project-description"><span class="fao-title">Target audience</span> = Families in Ontario and Media Outlets</p>
    <p class="project-description">With the topics that the FAO covers, it's important for consumers, especially media outlets, to understand
       Some users may not have the time to scroll through the whole
       report to understand the data and what it is covering.</p>

  <div class="reveal container"><h1 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Brainstorming</h1>
    
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Features & User Needs</h2>
    <p class="project-description">As directed by the communications lead, the interactive graph was to be created and it needed to have these main features: </p>
    <ul class="project-description">
      <li>The ability to select and display the different contribution and benefits categories.</li>
      <li>A responsive graph; Whatever the user selected should be reflected in the graph.</li>
      <li>An overall visual appealing and easy to use product; It should be easy for the user to understand how the graph works and how to use it.</li>
    </ul>  
    <h3 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Accessibility</h3>
    <p class="project-description">Another important thing to consider was the flexibility across different browsers and devices. The FAO reaches a wide audience which means the illustrator would be viewed on a wide array of browsers and devices. It has to be ensured that all users would be able to view and interact with the graph.
    </p>
    <h2 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Prototypes</h2>
    <p class="project-description">Once the initial features were decided and implemented, the Distribution Illustrator went through a number of iterations.</p>
    <p class="project-description">This is what one of the first iterations looked like. The main things that were pointed out to change by the 
      lead graphic designer and I were the colours, font, and size of the green markers. </p>

        <img class="reveal"style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/firstmockup.png" width="60%"/>

    <p class="project-description">On mobile, the graph looked squished so some of
    the text overlapped, the markers were too large, and the use of the darker blue wasn't eyecatching. The graph was also smaller compared to the rest of 
    the page on desktop.
  </p>



    <p class="project-description">Here, in a later mockup we changed the dark blue to pink and tested out a different version of the green marker.
      The colour change made the graph overall more eyecatching and bright. We also colour coded the Benefits and Taxes text so it's clear for users what the data
      they're looking at is.
    </p>

<img class="reveal"style="margin: auto;display: block;"src="images/mockup2.png" width="90%"/>
<p class="project-description">The graph legend was also placed in the graph originally which did look cramped.
</p>


    
    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">User Feedback and Testing</h2>
    <p class="project-description">After these intial prototypes and we got approval from the communications lead, we began user testing.</p>
    <p class="project-description">Members from the Communications and Financial teams were asked to test the illustrator and provide
      feedback regarding any glitches and how well it fulfilled user needs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Key Findings</h2>
    <ol class="project-description">
      <li>Some features need to be simplified; The user is able to select multiple options but that seemed to be too complex.</li>
      <li>The marker is fine as a circle, the size just need to be adjusted</li>
      <li>Need to keep accessbility standards in mind. Some of the text was too small or cramped on mobile versions.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="row">s
      <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
      <div class="col">
      <p class="project-description">Sticking with the brand colours, we chose to go with FAO blue, pink, and green for the bars. This provides colour contrast 
        so it's easy to depict between the different categories.

    <h2 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Layout & Features</h2>
    <h3 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Responsive Graph</h3>
    <p class="project-description">The user can select any benefit or contribution option and the graph will change and display
      data according to their choice. Originally the user was able to select multiple options but this was simplified to only one option
    at a time. </p>
    <p class="project-description">The user is also able to hover over the bars and the marker to get specific numbers.</p>
    <img style="margin: auto;display: block;" src="images/hover.gif" width="80%"/>
    <h3 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Dropdown Menu</h3>
    <p class="project-description">With simplifying the select feature, the original select menu was replaced with a dropdown menu.</p>
    <img style="margin: auto;display: block;" src="images/dropdown.gif" width="80%"/>
    <h3 class="fade-in project-subtitle">Reset Button</h3>
    <p class="project-description">We also decided to add a “reset” button to the graph as the user would have to keep refreshing
       the page to see the original graph before it was implemented.</p>
       <img style="margin: auto;display: block;" src="images/reset.gif" width="80%"/>
       <p class="project-description">For accessbility purposes, graphical descriptions were also added in case the illustrator couldn't be 
        used or displayed.</p>
      <img style="margin: auto;display: block;" src="images/graphdesc.gif" width="85%"/>
    <h2 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Final Product</h2>
    <p class="project-description">All of the mentioned features were able to be implented in the illustrator as showcased in the video by the Financial Accountability
      Office, Peter Weltman. </p>

  <!--Learnings-->
    <a id="takeaways"></a>
  <div class="reveal container" ><h1 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Takeaways & What I Learned</h1>
  <ul class="learnings">
    <li class="project-description">The importance of accessibility. Not all users have access to the same browsers and devices, or 
      something may be limiting them to have the same experience.
    </li>
    <li class="project-description">The project helped me to understand the importance of user feedback and testing; what I think may look and work well may not be the case for general users.</li>
    <li class="project-description">I was given the opportunity to take initiave and get different angles of the project. I was not only designing the overall layout and appearance
      of the graph, I was also implementing the proposed features.</li>
    <li class="project-description">Being able to quickly and properly adjust features based on feedback and user testing was an important skill; 
      I had to decide what was and what wasn’t possible in the time we had before the report was released.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="project-subtitle fao-title">Next Steps</h2>
  <ul class="learnings">
    <li class="project-description">Use this style of infographic for select future reports.</li>
    <li class="project-description">Improving features and accessibility so it can reach a bigger audience.</li>
